# Data-for-Boids-based-integration-algorithm-for-formation-and-obstacle-avoidance-in-MAS
Raw data is publicly available.
The data generated on Unity by the algorithm in this paper  is  available in the Github repository,https://github.com/Claire-Zhao200/Data-for-Boids-based-integration-algorithm-for-formation-and-obstacle-avoidance-in-MAS.git
The repository contains the data used for the four experiments in the thesis"Boids-based integration algorithm for formation and obstacle avoidance in multi-agent systems".
